        Study tour/ Excursion  is an excellent way of relieving students from the monotonous studies for a certain period.  It is a part and parcel of our educational life. Study tour  helps to develop practical knowledge. Study tour gives us a better knowledge of different places of the world. It increases the horizon of our mind and broadens our outlook. Study  tour means earning knowledge by journey. It helps us to see the unseen, to know the unknown and to explore the new things. During the last winter vacation I and some of students planned to go to a study tour to Haripur Rajbari which is situated at Haripur union in Brahmanbaria District.  Some of the students, along with I, of our class went there.We were 50 students in number.  We went there with two of our class teachers such as Ripon Sir and Oly sir.Two luxurious buses were hired for this purpose. We started our journey at 6:30 a.m. from our school campus. We reached our destination at about 11: a.m. In the spot, we visited many ancient historical things.We saw natural sights, vast expanse of water of the Titas, waves of the river, many boats in the Titas bank. We became astonished to the natural scenery of the river and this old palace . We walked there for a long time.The palace is famous for its natural beauties and artistic pattern . We gathered practical knowledge observing those things of our traditional customs . We passed there six hours. We bathed in the water of the Titas, made a lot of fun and took snaps of us with different interesting things. We ate rice with special fish. The free movement in that place gave us much pleasure. Actually the tour was very important for taking fresh air and enjoyment and gathering practical knowledge.
Indeed, the day was very enjoyable and we gathered some new experiences from this.
It was really a memorable day in my life.
